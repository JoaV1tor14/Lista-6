Read an integer value N, ensuring that this value is between the range [1, 200]. Present the square of each of the even values ​​from 1 to N, including N, if applicable

2. Read an integer value N. Return all numbers between 1 and 10000 that divided by N give a remainder equal to 2. 3. Read 1 integer value N, which represents the number of test cases that follow. Each test case consists in 3 real values. Present the weighted average for each of these sets of 3 values, with the first value has weight 2, second value has weight 3 and third value has weight 5. Present the result always using 1 decimal place after the comma. 4. Write a program that repeats reading a password until it is valid. For each password read incorrectly informed, write the message "Password Invalid". When the password is entered correctly, the message "Access Allowed" and the algorithm terminated. Assume the correct password is the value 2002. 5. Write a program that reads 2 values ​​X and Y and that prints all values ​​between them whose remainder of the division of it by 5 is equal to 2 or equal to 3. 6. This program must read an integer variable X numerous times (it must stop when the value entered is equal to zero). For each value read, print the sequence from 1 to X, with a space between each number and its successor.
